This dataset was smaller than that used in the second paper which showed positive treatment effects for everyone's employment and earnings. The second paper, due to a lack of data on informal sectors, cannot do a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. The first paper also has this problem, with the formal==0 meaning unemployment or informal sector. As such, the first paper should use the \"conservative\" analysis that the second does (assuming no employment growth in the informal sector) to establish a lower-bound."

        "A good summary of the papers is that the first describes the initial results of a program, pending further robust research as given in the second paper. The first is a smaller dataset, the second is larger. The first (probably) has a weaker signal, the second has a stronger one. Overall, both show that this training program *is*, on average, beneficial to those who are able to take part. The results are conclusive enough to adopt the program on a greater scale. There would be new observations in locational fixtures, but the locations were taken into account in the datasets. The signal in some locations was likely not very high, but the overall results seem to show an improvement with treatment. A problem that the government would have to account for is volunteering. The papers describe that similar programs often have difficulty applying treatment to a randomization of the population because certain people (especially women) do not sign up for treatment even though it is shown to help. A solution could be to... force treatment, but that isn't even a perfect solution because that wouldn't guarantee the same results as the randomized trails in the paper (forced treatment effect != volunteered treatment effect). A better, harder, solution would be to initiate education/opportunity programs across the country alongside the ability to train. There are likely many psychological factors that could help improve volunteer randomization. Additionally, it would probably be wise to establish certain criteria for people to get treatment/training to maximize cost-benefit (ex: work a certain amount of years before training). This could be tuned to maximize cost-benefit for (an assumed) randomized treated individual. \n",
